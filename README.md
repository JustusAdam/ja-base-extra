# ja-base-extra [![Hackage Status](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/ja-base-extra.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ja-base-extra)

Or **j**ustus-**a**dam-base-extra. That's the expanded form.

This is a library of small helper functions that I use and that depend only on the `base` library. But of which I am certain they would never be added to the actual `base` library.


## Usage

Just add as dependency and done. (I'll push it to hackage soon™)

## Naming

This library is named after me for two reasons:

1. because it is an opinionated library of things that I thought were necessary and
2. because naming it and the included modules something generic is not cool, if it is not generic by design (like the `extra` library)

## Documentation

Haddock documentation is provided. If you are unhappy with the documentation [let me know](mailto:dev@justus.science) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/JustusAdam/ja-base-extra/compare).
