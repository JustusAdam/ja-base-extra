# ja-base-extra

Or **j**ustus-**a**dam-base-extra. That's the expanded form.

This is a library of small helper functions that I use and that depend only on the `base` library. But of which I am certain they would never be added to the actual `base` library.


## Usage

Just add as dependency and done. (I'll push it to hackage soon™)

## Naming

This library is named after me for two reasons:

1. because it is an opinionated library of things that I thought were necessary and
2. because naming it and the included mocules something generic is not cool, if it is not generig by design (like the `extra` library)

## Documentation

Haddock docks coming soon™
